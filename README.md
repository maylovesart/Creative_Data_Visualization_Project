**Creative_Data_Visualization_Project**
Interactive data visualization project using Python, Plotly, and ML. Features 3D scatter plots, choropleth maps, and predictive modeling. Demonstrates creative tech skills in data processing, visualization, and basic AI. Ideal for exploring innovative ways to present complex data.

**Features**

Data generation and preprocessing
Basic machine learning for predictive modeling
Interactive 3D scatter plot visualization
Global choropleth map visualization
Matplotlib-based comparative visualization

**Technologies Used**

Python
Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
Scikit-learn for machine learning
Plotly for interactive visualizations
Matplotlib for static visualizations

Installation
This project is designed to run in Google Colab, which requires no local installation. However, if you wish to run it locally:

Clone this repository:
Copygit clone https://github.com/yourusername/creative-data-visualization.git

Install the required dependencies:
Copypip install pandas numpy scikit-learn plotly matplotlib


**Usage**

Open the Jupyter notebooks in Google Colab or your local Jupyter environment.
Run the cells in order to generate data, process it, and create visualizations.
Interact with the Plotly visualizations to explore the data from different angles.
